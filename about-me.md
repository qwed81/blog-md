# About Me

## High School
While growing up I have always had an interest in programming 
Before high school, I struggled to get started. After taking a course in high school,
I had the fundamentals required to start learning on my own through
building projects and online resources. My first long-term project
was in 10th grade, and it involved building a game engine in Java. As
a naive young coder, I thought using libraries was cheating, and therefore
spent months figuring out all of the math from scratch without looking at
resources. That took 3 months and all my focus, and quite
frankly I'm surprised It was working using the basic Java graphics API.
However, spending time on that project gave me the confidence that I could
program many other projects. A couple of weeks later, I decided to
make a program that would allow dynamic macros, but this time in C++.
C++ however was beyond my skills at that time, and even
though I accomplished what I wanted, C++ became enemy number 1.

In my junior year of high school, I was curious about which field I wanted to join
as a programmer, but I was set on software engineering as my career.
After taking a video programming class, I realized
I did not like working on games, but instead fell in love with the C#
language. I found myself messing around making
desktop apps with WPF. I used WPF to make a note-taking app that used
a trie to search keywords making finding notes almost instant. I also
made a chess app that would allow me to play multiple chess.com games
online at once using my user interface. Even though I accomplished this
by scraping their web data and running an instance of chromium
with a C# wrapper in the background, it was good enough for me.
Later that year I messed around with
building mobile apps with Microsoft Xamarin. However, the developer
experience using Xamarin was miserable as Android emulation would not work on
my computer so I gave up on that idea. 					 

It is fitting that my last project in high school was for the school.
My Physics C class
had a discord server and it become a meme that we needed inspirational 
quotes in the morning to make it to class. My teacher asked if I could throw
something together, and after a couple of days, I got it working.
I used the discord API to post messages from AI-generated inspirational quotes
in the chat every morning at 8:00 am. I wish
I knew the importance of version control back then as now all of those
projects are lost and as a result can not see the evidence of progress I have 
made.

## University
In the summer after high school, my friend came to me with an idea for a
startup that he wanted to make. It involved a browser extension that would
allow people to post information about the websites they were visiting and others
would be able to see the footnotes they left. It sounded like a good idea at the
time but I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I spent the first few
months learning the basics of the web. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and made the first
iteration. However, we both did not like the design and decided to change it, a
theme that became way too common until I quit. He continued working on it without me, and
a lot of my work is still in production at

At some point prior we changed
the idea from a social media app to an educational app that allowed teachers to
make lessons by placing questions on articles for students to answer. Never working
on a project for more than 3 months before this, I made some bad decisions
on the technology used. I was sick of JavaScript as we had so many bugs
from type issues that I decided to switch from Express to Asp.Net core.
While it is good that I learned multiple web frameworks, a lot of work had to be 
done again, and this came with additional features we wanted. I learned about
typescript and react at the same time, so decided to use it as a frontend library
that would handle the UI that we served to users.

Even though it did not result in a successful startup, I learned so much from the
experience it was well worth the time.

- Version control and collaboration
- Web technologies: JavaScript, CSS, Html, Typescript
- Frameworks: Express, React, Asp.net core
- Managing a team of interns to get work done

In the summer going into sophomore year my love for C# declined as I learned about
the performance and stability of Rust programs. Writing multi-threaded programs
that never crashed and performed even at 80% of the speed of C programs was 
something that my eyes were opened to. I spend hours learning about the language
to master it as I had found expected It would be an amazing tool in building
most projects. Later that year I took a class on 
programming in Unix and fell in love with the simplicity of C and the miracle
it is still around 50 years after its invention. If I loved C and Rust, maybe
the Linux community is onto something. Turns out they were! I installed Linux
and now use neovim to do most tasks.
